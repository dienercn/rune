# Business Model & Monetization

## Guiding Principles

Our monetization strategy is built on a core philosophy of enhancing the RUNE ecosystem, not extracting value from it. Our principles are as follows:

* **Runner-First:** The core experience for runners will always be free. Our growth depends on building a vibrant, accessible community without barriers to entry.
* **Value-Based Exchange:** We will monetize the demonstrable value and efficiency we provide to community organizers (Providers) and brand partners (Sponsors).
* **Privacy by Design:** All monetization strategies, especially concerning sponsors, must be built on a foundation of user trust and data privacy, adhering to regulations like GDPR.

## Runner (Core User)

The RUNE platform is **free** for all runners. This includes discovering and booking events, participating in challenges, connecting with other runners, and managing their profile.

## Provider (Community Organizer)

We will utilize a "Value-Added Tools" Freemium model to empower providers of all sizes.

#### **Free Tier**
Designed to be fully functional for most new and small-to-medium-sized running communities.
* **Core Functionality:** Includes event creation, participant management via check-in, and a public community page.
* **Generous Limits:** The free tier will have generous usage limits for the number of events and participants.

#### **Pro Tier (Paid Subscription)**
A monthly or annual subscription that unlocks a powerful suite of integrated tools designed for serious community organizers who want to save time, engage their members more deeply, and prove their community's value.

* **Advanced Analytics:** Access to a dashboard with data on attendance trends, no-show rates, member engagement over time, and community growth metrics.
* **Integrated Communication Tools:** The ability to send targeted emails or push notifications to community members based on their activity and event history (e.g., messaging everyone who attended a previous trail run about a new one).
* **Sponsor Management & ROI Reporting:** The ability to seamlessly integrate sponsor-provided benefits into their events and access reports showing attendee engagement with those benefits, providing demonstrable ROI to their partners.

## Sponsor (Brand Partner)

#### The "Targeted Access" Model
Our model is built on protecting our users' privacy. Sponsors will **not** be given direct access to runners' Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Instead, RUNE will offer a self-service platform where sponsors pay to run highly-targeted campaigns directed at anonymized user segments within the RUNE ecosystem.

#### Monetization Products
Sponsors can purchase the following campaign types on a flexible basis:

1.  **Sponsored Events:** A brand can pay a fee to have their logo and branding prominently featured as the official sponsor on specific event pages.
2.  **Targeted Digital Rewards:** Sponsors can pay to deliver a digital benefit (e.g., a discount coupon, a product trial) to a specific audience based on their verified activity on the platform (e.g., runners in a certain city who have completed their first 10k race).
3.  **Event-Centric Sponsored Challenges:** Sponsoring challenges that require users to participate in community events. Examples include:
    * **"Community Explorer" Challenge:** Rewarding users for attending events from several different communities.
    * **"Provider Loyalty" Challenge:** Rewarding users for frequent attendance at a specific partner community's events.
4.  **Branded Content Hub:** Sponsors can pay to publish valuable, non-disruptive content such as training plans, nutrition guides, or articles within a dedicated section of the app, building brand authority and trust.

# 💸 Monetization Concept for RUNE

RUNE is designed to empower runners, support community providers, and unlock high-value marketing for sponsors — all while offering a sustainable, scalable business model.

---

## 🎽 1. Free for Runners – Community-First Approach

### 🧭 Rationale:
To build a strong, loyal user base, runners must be able to use RUNE completely free of charge. Their data, engagement, and presence form the foundation of the ecosystem — so monetization must focus on indirect value from their activity.

### ✅ What Runners Get for Free:
- Full access to search, filter, and book events  
- Daily feed and personalized suggestions  
- Check-in and participation tracking  
- Connecting with other runners  
- Earning and redeeming rewards  
- Viewing sponsor offerings (optional engagement)

### 💡 Optional Additions:
- Option to tip/support communities they love  
- Voluntary opt-in for tailored sponsor benefits

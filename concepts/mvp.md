# RUNE: MVP Definition & Strategy Document
**Date:** July 16, 2025
**Version:** 1.0

## 1. Project Vision

RUNE empowers runners to effortlessly discover meaningful events, forge authentic connections, and embrace the joy of movement through every stride. We envision a world where running is more than a sport—it’s a shared journey that unites, inspires, and transforms lives. This document outlines the business model and feature scope for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) designed to validate this vision.

## 2. Business Model & Monetization

### Guiding Principles

* **Runner-First:** The core experience for runners will always be free to maximize community growth.
* **Value-Based Exchange:** We will monetize the demonstrable value and efficiency we provide to community organizers (Providers) and brand partners (Sponsors).
* **Privacy by Design:** All monetization strategies will be built on a foundation of user trust and data privacy.

### Runner (Core User)

The RUNE platform is **free** for all runners.

### Provider (Community Organizer)

We will utilize a **"Value-Added Tools" Freemium model**.

* **Free Tier:** Offers generous limits for basic event creation and management.
* **Pro Tier (Paid Subscription):** Unlocks a powerful suite of integrated tools, including advanced analytics, contextual communication tools, and sponsor management & ROI reporting features.

### Sponsor (Brand Partner)

We will use a **"Targeted Access" model** that protects user privacy. Sponsors pay to run campaigns within the RUNE ecosystem without receiving direct access to user data.

* **Monetization Products:**
    1.  **Sponsored Events:** Brand placement on event pages.
    2.  **Targeted Digital Rewards:** Delivery of coupons/benefits to specific, anonymized user segments.
    3.  **Event-Centric Sponsored Challenges:** Sponsoring challenges that require participation in community events.
    4.  **Branded Content Hub:** Publishing valuable sponsored content (e.g., training plans).
